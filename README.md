### 0.2.2

* Added Bower support
* Fixing oj.toCSS to correctly accept minify option

* Adding `insert` event to tag functions that is triggered when the element is inserted

* Rewrote oj.js into JavaScript (from CoffeeScript)
* Minified code is now 16% smaller
* Performance is 10% faster
* Removed id generation for root object elements
* Remove oj.id and oj.guid methods since id generation isn't necessary
* Removed typeOf method as it was slow and for the most part unused
* Remove several internal helper functions

### 0.1.6

* Fixes npm package management

### 0.1.5

* Minor fix to npm package to ensure it works without coffee-script installed globally.

### 0.1.4

* Plugins now include themselves once required in node or included with a `<script>` tag client-side
